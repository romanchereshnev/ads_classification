      "im just mud\n",
      "poor dogs dont even know to do none of their behaviors\n",

      "well yeah i think all my fault\n",
      "that seems to be true among them\n",
      "like like i want to say not high end but a good dog trainers a professional dog trainer high end trainers\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "they they would agree that not just with you but any dogs bad behavior as a result of their human not training them well or properly or at all\n",
      "true\n",
      "although i will say i mean any dog can be trained supposedly\n",
      "ive seen those shows\n",
      "but you know my dog nico is just so\n",
      "hotwired when someone jumps over now shes the the brendel\n",
      "ok just so hotwired when people come over that i just dont know what to do\n",

      "okay\n",

      "its like its very very tough to rein her in when someone knocks on that door and comes over\n",
      "okay\n",
      "shell chill out after 10 minutes better\n",
      "its just hard to not get her to jump up on people and stuff because they got to be in on it too you know\n",
      "well i would say that probably any high end dog trainer would wouldnt say that you should give her tranquilizers all the time especially when somebody is coming over\n",
      "well you let her sleep her life away\n",
      "your instinct as a dog owner is when someone comes over your dog jumps on him and say now nico get down get off of them and even like pull them off\n",
      "but this article says like no it even a scolding is reinforcing that behavior because all that dog wants is attention\n",
      "even if its a scolding\n",
      "right\n",
      "and if you if you say no or whatever the dog gets the attention it prefer positive attention where you like\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "jump up\n",
      "thats great\n",
      "but itll take you know nico or any other dog will take\n",
      "well take that\n",
      "they know what they say to do is to just ignore it\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "just ignore the dog until theyre doing what you want them to do and then reward the dog\n",
      "and i think that what you just said and im glad you said it because we really need to get this across\n",
      "what people have been discovering more and more about dog training in the last like 20 years is that having a dog and raising a good dog is requires way more than we previously thought it did\n",
      "yeah way more attention\n",
      "way more research\n",
      "way more patients\n",
      "way more persistence\n",
      "way more than it used to\n",
      "and rightfully so\n",
      "i mean it should require this\n",
      "and one of the reasons why it does require more is because theres been a real shift in mentality over what direction you should take to train a dog\n",
      "i keep saying raise the dog\n",
      "i think thats a good way to put it too\n",
      "yeah sure\n",
      "but it used to be different and it still is that way for some people as well see\n",
      "but there there used to be much easier because you just asserted yourself physically psychologically\n",
      "you yelled at your dog you spanked your dog and you basically showed your dog who is boss\n",
      "and then after that they would just kind of behave\n",
      "theyre saying like no dont do that anymore\n",
      "thats not good\n",
      "it really has really terrible effects on the dog\n",
      "it harms your relationship with the dog\n",
      "and instead you really need to just give 110 percent whereas before youre giving maybe 50 percent\n",
      "thats right\n",
      "so what youre talking about are the two main approaches dominance or positive reinforcement\n",
      "positive reinforcement is a straight up operant conditioning technique where you reward your dog for good behaviors or i guess we should even say good and bad\n",
      "they say not to do that with children and dogs\n",
      "yeah desirable behaviors and a focus on what a dog should do\n",
      "whereas dominance is a technique to discourage unwanted behaviors\n",
      "what you should not do and the whole dominance theory is based on this idea and this has been around since\n",
      "well who knows where it got its original start but at least since the 70s\n",
      "yeah there are these dog training monks in cambridge new york called the new skeet monks\n",
      "and they are monks who raise and breed german shepherds\n",
      "sure\n",
      "and write doctrine books\n",
      "all right\n",
      "well i mean thats monks are supposed to give something back to the world some to get through beer\n",
      "and these guys train dogs\n",
      "i like the beer brewers\n",
      "better cider\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "its been at least around since then\n",
      "but this is based on the the idea that dogs are really just wolves 20 in dogs clothing here and that wolves we should look at the behavior of wolves and their pack animals with an alpha male and an alpha female will get more into that and we can extrapolate that to dogs\n",
      "and so thats how and this is what these monks say too\n",
      "thats what you should be doing is mimicking what wolves do\n",
      "and\n",
      "well\n",
      "but say the wild\n",
      "not that\n",
      "not the case really\n",
      "what wolves have been studied doing in captivity which is a key point\n",
      "right\n",
      "and then like because they have pacts with a leader call an alpha male an alpha female the alpha male and female maintain their position through dominance through acts of like aggression\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "violence\n",
      "and that theyre constantly challenged for these positions\n",
      "so that so much so that this constant struggle over dominance and alpha adam is what shapes wolf\n",
      "society and that if you take that and you just assume like you said that dogs are just a different type of wolf that theyre so closely related to wolves and descended from wolves that the same kind of mentality applies to dogs\n",
      "if you create that\n",
      "kind of situation in your own home\n",
      "you will have a happier or more obedient dog who understands its place in this household which to your dog is just a pack\n",
      "thats right\n",
      "this is started in the 1960s\n",
      "there were a bunch of studies observing these wolf packs and their social structures\n",
      "i saw it even earlier than that\n",
      "i saw a guy named rudolf schenkel was doing this in 1947 and that hes the one who coined the site the idea and the term alpha\n",
      "and he was also the guitarist for the scorpions if im not mistaken\n",
      "i think you think in a john fogartys guitarist which is that it was his brother rudy schenkel pretty cool\n",
      "so yeah\n",
      "so theyre there observing these wolves and theyre saying that theres a continual pattern in them in the pack of the male members vying for control challenging the alpha then the alpha putting it down usually physically and also psychologically\n",
      "i guess as much as you can get into the psychology of a wolf\n",
      "and heres the thing\n",
      "i mean should we go ahead and say what the deal is\n",
      "i feel like thats or should that be a third x spoiler\n",
      "no no\n",
      "i think we can go ahead\n",
      "all right\n",
      "i said they were studying captive wolves\n",
      "thats thats the rub here is that theyre studying wolves in captivity\n",
      "and it took this other guy in the\n",
      "when was that than the 90s\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "david mack\n",
      "yeah that actually studied wolves in the wild\n",
      "and hes like thats not whats going on at all because youre its like studying humans in a refugee camp or a prison\n",
      "like the behaviors arent gon na be the same\n",
      "what im observing is these animals that follow what most animals in the animal kingdom do or many which is their their families\n",
      "and the alpha is the alpha course\n",
      "hes the dad\n",
      "right\n",
      "exactly\n",
      "then like when they said like oh no wolves are constantly you know under these physical attacks for their status as the alpha alpha wolf\n",
      "they what they were saying was like these these wolves are in a completely unnatural setting in situation\n",
      "and youve got a bunch of different alphas who are trying to figure out whos in charge\n",
      "and yeah there was a lot of aggression and dominance but this was a terrible thing to base this idea on how to train a dog because it was a totally artificial situation\n",
      "and it wasnt until i think\n",
      "what did you say 1990 that meck\n",
      "he actually revised an earlier book\n",
      "he wrote a book in 1980 that took these earlier ideas and said yeah these are totally correct\n",
      "and now hes like i wish id never i got it so wrong\n",
      "yes there is dominance\n",
      "there are alphas\n",
      "but its like you said chuck their mom and dad\n",
      "thats what we would call them\n",
      "just right\n",
      "just in the same way that your mom and your dad are the boss of you and youre a kid\n",
      "same thing in a wolf pack\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "and dad goes out and gets the food moms takes care of the kids and protects the kids and access you know the defensive guard over their den\n",
      "yes\n",
      "and thats just how it works\n",
      "and then after a couple of years the male puppies i guess leave\n",
      "they become alphas of their own families\n",
      "and he observed the stuff over whereas at canadas ellesmere island every summer for 13 years and that island has the best carnival in canada\n",
      "it really changed the way people looked at wolves and aragao dogs\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "for the what the revision of it or the earlier stuff\n",
      "well the revision of it\n",
      "sure\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "it totally did because everybody realized that this dominance based training that people had been doing where you basically beat up your dog\n",
      "if there if there is like a sense of like alpha dumb that your dog is following your dog is basically like my dad is beating me up and yelling at me all the time\n",
      "and im just scared and anxious about everything\n",
      "so the did the dog training world realize that this is what was happening that it was based on faulty preliminary original research and they they switched\n",
      "they changed\n",
      "they went to a much more respectful happier friendlier way of training that doesnt involve punishment\n",
      "it involves basically rewards and extinctions as well\n",
      "well look at later on\n",
      "all right\n",
      "well lets take a break\n",

      "one is called the alpha role not r o l e\n",
      "thats right the other r o l l got it\n",
      "so this is when the trainer will ah\n",
      "you know i guess if youre the owner and trainer will pin the dog on its back and hold the dog there by the chest or the throat\n",
      "mm hmm\n",
      "until the dog gives in and then stops the struggle\n",
      "ok that is slightly different than dominants down\n",
      "that is pinning the dog on its side until the dog stops struggling\n",
      "so same thing\n",
      "i mean you got a dog that is doing something that you dont want it to do\n",
      "so you are pinning it\n",
      "youre physically restraining in an aggressive manner until it just basically dies inside\n",
      "i will say that i have i have done the dominants down before because of a dog fight between my two dogs\n",
      "ok\n",
      "getting the dog separated and then you know pinning one down until they calm down\n",
      "one thing i saw somewhere i dont know where i saw it but the actually ive heard it i heard a little while ago the way that you break up a dog fight is you grab them by the backlight is to rub yourself a stake\n",
      "just walk through me like this\n",
      "why fight when you can have state\n",
      "grab the back legs\n",
      "yeah that makes sense\n",
      "heres the thing though\n",
      "if youve ever been involved in a dog fight up close its an adrenaline rush\n",
      "you dont know quite what to do now\n",
      "and its scary\n",
      "its like super scary\n",
      "yeah well your brain just becomes totally like my brain becomes clouded when like momos starts barking at somebody\n",
      "im like i get all flustered\n",
      "and whatever a dog fight is like it is one of the most fluttering like clouding experiences you can you can have\n",
      "ive heard throw water on him\n",
      "i could see that\n",
      "i could also see him just fighting right through the water if the fight is bad enough\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "i mean my dog lucy who isnt with us got into a fight with my former co dog jake the pit bull who you know my friend justin ended up taking\n",
      "and it was ugly men\n",
      "and theyre both not with us and theyre both really sweet dogs\n",
      "but they looked at each other wrong\n",
      "and it was on from the get go man\n",
      "and like lucy took off part of jakes ear and it was just like\n",
      "its bad how scary you dont know what to do\n",
      "right\n",
      "and so a person who who is who subscribes to dominance theory training says you need to show that both of those dogs that youre in charge and you tell them theyre not fighting theyre that theyre acting out theyre misbehaving because they dont understand their role\n",
      "but at the same time i would be like well no it sounds like that doesnt necessarily mean that they dont think youre the alpha\n",
      "theyre trying to figure out what their position over one another in this package or just dogs being dogs man\n",
      "thats another way to look at it for sure\n",
      "you know like you know lucy got attacked at a dog park when she was young\n",
      "and from that day forward was you know if a dog was slightly aggressive it was on and scary\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "so we can take her around other dogs\n",
      "so the upshot\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "and they would say so\n",
      "one of the other things i want to call out here rather than waiting\n",
      "when a dog acts aggressively every trainer ive seen on both sides says that its fearful that the dog is actually afraid\n",
      "oh that was for sure\n",
      "lucys case\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "so yeah\n",
      "and thats why i thought of that because you know she had a negative experience and she was afraid\n",
      "so she would act aggressive in the face of fear\n",
      "so one of the reasons why people criticize dominance training as well see is that you are physically and aggressively punishing aggressive behavior\n",
      "right\n",
      "so your fear punishing a dog for feeling fearful which is going to make it more fearful of whatever it is its afraid of at that moment which means its actually probably likelier that it will become more aggressive\n",
      "right\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "its like a human kid too\n",
      "you know if you have a kid who has learned to be aggressive and your way of disciplining them is to hit them like what he thinks going to happen\n",
      "i dont know\n",
      "i dont know anything about human kids\n",
      "i only know about dogs\n",
      "theyre the same\n",
      "so back to the the physical methods of dominance training those alpha role dominance down\n",
      "theres these scruff shake\n",
      "mm hmm\n",
      "so when he grabbed the dogs jowls their scruff with both hands and shake it really hard and stare them stare them in the eyes\n",
      "lease jerk if youre on a on a walk with your dog and theyre pulling you let them get up ahead and then jerk back really really hard\n",
      "sure\n",
      "and then using choke collars or pinch collars or shock collars instead of like the more humane gentle leaders what they call them\n",
      "right\n",
      "it sort of looks like a muzzle but when the dog pulls it just sort of pulls their nose down\n",
      "they dont like that\n",
      "right\n",
      "thats for the other kind of dominance the gentle leader\n",
      "physically hurting them when they pull on the leash\n",
      "correct\n",
      "or when you jerk the leash back\n",
      "right\n",
      "or the choke pinch or shock collars are all dominance\n",
      "right\n",
      "or theres psychological methods to staring at the dog till the dog looks away\n",
      "like im boss\n",
      "whos gon na blink first\n",
      "you dog\n",
      "you all right\n",
      "or growling at a dog or making dog noises to the dog is another dominance technique\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "psychological dominance\n",
      "right\n",
      "so\n",
      "so youve got all these techniques\n",
      "as far as dominance training goes if you employ them in a consistent manner\n",
      "eventually your dog is going to figure out whos boss\n",
      "and they the people who subscribe to dominance theory say this is actually a gift to your dog\n",
      "right\n",
      "because if your dog is acting improperly if its misbehaving if its being aggressive its asserting itself because it doesnt realize that youre the alpha because you havent asserted yourself over your dog\n",
      "and so somebodys got to be the alpha\n",
      "so this dog is confused and is trying to step up\n",
      "so if you assert your dominance over this dog you will reassure that if there is an alpha in charge and it can just relax and be a good happy dog\n",
      "thats what people who who subscribe to dominance theory say is the whole purpose of dominance theory\n",
      "right\n",
      "on the other side you have people saying no your dog is not just becoming super happy because they know youre in charge\n",
      "theyre going on into shut down mode basically because theyre afraid to do stuff and theyre basically living in a state of shut down mode because theyre afraid of being alpha rolled or barked at or pinned or whatever\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "and so that what theyll do is heres the thing and this is really important to remember\n",
      "nobodys saying dominance training doesnt actually at least in the short term curb problem behavior and dies\n",
      "but the way that youre doing is actually like breaking the dogs spirit\n",
      "youre not youre not providing it this comfortable position in the household\n",
      "its pack\n",
      "youre basically just breaking the spirit so that it doesnt do anything until you tell it to do something\n",
      "its that shut down that you were just talking about\n",
      "and people who subscribe to the other way say no theres a theres a different better way to do this which doesnt involve breaking the dog which allows the dog to lead a happier healthier life\n",
      "and theres whats called the least intrusive minimally aversive list of how to train a dog\n",
      "and using dominance theory techniques are well at the bottom of this list\n",
      "yeah i think they listed six things\n",
      "and that was number six was a positive punishment\n",
      "mm hmm\n",
      "which is a bit of a contradiction in terms i guess but\n",
      "yeah yeah\n",
      "lets talk about that\n",
      "yeah thats what the whole list are\n",
      "just the positive punishment\n",
      "well just about the\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "the punishment problem\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "i mean thats when youre delivering what they called an aversive consequence or i guess the first consequence to reduce probability that a behavior will occur\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "so in this in the sense positive and negative doesnt necessarily mean like good or bad\n",
      "right\n",
      "it can easing the introduction or the removal of something\n",
      "right\n",
      "so you can have a negative reward where something bad is removed in reward for the you know the dog doing the behavior you want\n",
      "and then you also have negative punishment where you remove something good when the dog does something you dont want it to do\n",
      "you also have positive rewards which is basically giving a treat to a dog\n",
      "it does something good\n",
      "you say hey hugo or praise or something like that\n",
      "sure\n",
      "and then positive punishment which sounds like okay thats an alright kind of punishment\n",
      "thats actually the worst of all of them as far as most professional dog trainers are concerned\n",
      "that is where youre introducing a punishment because the dog is doing something\n",
      "so youre yelling at the dog youre alpha rolling the dog youre spanking the dog\n",
      "youre introducing a punishment as a response for an unwanted behavior in this hope to train the dog\n",
      "and so they say well heres theres the basic problem right there with dominance theory and dominance training is that eventually youre going to come to positive punishment\n",
      "its woven into the fabric of dominance theory\n",
      "and if youre\n",
      "punishing your dog if youre yelling at your dog or alphaville your dog\n",
      "youre going to create this shut down dog\n",
      "and whats more it seems that positive punishment as far as training techniques conditioning operant conditioning techniques go is the least effective of all of those four\n",
      "and not its not just dog trainers saying that even bf skinner himself who created a skinner box and raises poor little barefoot electrocuted children\n",
      "and he said yes positive punishment is the least effective of all of these\n",
      "yeah they say the number one on that list is health nutritional and physical factors\n",
      "and this is basically setting up your house\n",
      "then being assured that your dog is like healthy and wellfed mean like theres nothing physically wrong with the dog\n",
      "yeah like if your dog is peeing in the house and wont get housebroken theyre saying the first step you should do is take your dog to a vet and make sure it doesnt have like a urinary tract infection\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "i mean lets go over this list because thats really helpful\n",
      "there was the association of professional dog trainers have a list of misinterpretations urinating the houses\n",
      "one of them a dominance explanation would be like no theyre peeing on your bed because theyre trying to show say like this is my territory\n",
      "its a really paranoid place to come from you know\n",
      "oh the dog\n",
      "the dog thinks hes better than me\n",
      "what was really going on they say is that its just that horsetrading has been inconsistent\n",
      "yes\n",
      "which\n",
      "sorry\n",
      "you have a urinary tract infection or something\n",
      "right\n",
      "and you would find that out by taking that first step which is taking the dog to the vet to make sure there isnt a health or medical issue that can solve this problem\n",
      "because again it all comes down to this problem behavior\n",
      "why is the dog doing it or what do you want the dog to do instead\n",
      "right\n",
      "jumping up on people\n",
      "this is nico steele\n",
      "a dominants explanation would be that shes doing this to assert their height and rank over you like im just as big as you are\n",
      "whereas whats really going on is she wants to lick your face and its fun and shes excited and wants to say hello\n",
      "right\n",
      "so what you would do is you would say teach your dog to sit whenever you go to open the door or something like that\n",
      "or if your dog is jumping up to to ignore it until its sitting with all all four paws on the floor and then you reward it cause its like you were saying one of the easiest ways to train your dog is accidentally\n",
      "and what youre doing is training your dog to do all the stuff you dont want your dog to do\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "i mean you come home from vacation and nico jumps up on you like your first instinct is to kiss her face and tell her how good it is to see her\n",
      "and thats the wrong thing to do\n",
      "like im good at that\n",
      "like i can come in and just turn my back and ignore and it works\n",
      "but you got to get people coming in the house all your friends coming in and family\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "everyones got to be on board\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "like like momma barks at strangers when they come into our house\n",
      "she does not like to like say a contractor coming over to to bark or to come to her house\n",
      "she should like it\n",
      "so ideally i would give the stranger treats say the contractor trilby likes liked by the way\n",
      "can you show up 5 minutes early to an appointment\n",
      "im going to give you a dog lie to treat under the door\n",
      "you and i are going to go and sit and get situated at the at the table\n",
      "at the dinner table\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "were gon na just talk calmly and then my wife is going to bring my dog into the room and youre going to give her a treat right\n",
      "dont stand up in the presence of my dog\n",
      "once my wife removes our dog then we can go on with our appointment\n",
      "i love it\n",
      "that would be the ideal thing\n",
      "what this what this thing says to do is okay instead of all that\n",
      "just keep your dog outside\n",
      "go hang out outside with your dog\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "make us see your dog has no idea anybody even came over\n",
      "yeah thats easier sometimes\n",
      "yes\n",
      "thats the number two thing that youre supposed to do after taking the dog to a vet is just changing the dogs world\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "so that the problem behavior doesnt exist because the thing that creates that problem behavior isnt part of the dogs world anymore\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "situation last week where i was out of town\n",
      "you know we had our house worked on and the contractor the framer guy who was there most of the time like handson really loves dogs and loves our dogs\n",
      "but he had to come over and do something\n",
      "he hadnt been over in a while and i was gone and i was like you know i can tell you how to get in my house if you want to go put them in the in the bedroom so the plumber can come in\n",
      "was like this is on you man\n",
      "if you want to do this hes like sure ill do it\n",
      "and he came in and text me afterward that said that charlie\n",
      "he said as soon as i walked in bolted and ran into the bedroom basically\n",
      "oh\n",
      "and that nico like barked embarked and then was just like downstairs trembling and afraid\n",
      "and he eventually was like come on nico come on up\n",
      "and he got her into the bedroom\n",
      "that is so bad\n",
      "that is so sad\n",
      "its but its also really sad too when you think about your dog\n",
      "you know barking or being aggressive or something\n",
      "oh yeah\n",
      "when youre just like oh its so obnoxious\n",
      "be quiet\n",
      "but then if you realize like theyre actually doing it cause theyre scared which now makes the whole thing just heartbreaking\n",
      "but i think its a really important thing to remember too because it changes your perspective on how it goes from being like stop being aggressive stopping hostile you know to to realizing youre saying stop being afraid you know stuffing a chicken\n",
      "thats no way to talk to something that you love\n",
      "and that holds true for a dog too\n",
      "so to think that really kind of changes your perspective\n",
      "yeah the\n",
      "of my monologue and then a couple of other behaviors pulling on a leash a dominants explanation might be that no theyre trying to assert that theyre the alphen get out in front of you and be in charge whereas whats really get known on is your dogs excited to be on a walk and they love to get out there and smell things\n",
      "mm hmm\n",
      "and thats why theyre pulling\n",
      "and then finally running through the doorway\n",
      "first i get run over by my dogs all the time trying to get outside\n",
      "sure\n",
      "and the dominance theory is that theyre trying to push you out of the way to show you theyre in charge\n",
      "again they what theyre doing is pushing out of the way because youre blocking them from getting outside to where they love life a lot more\n",
      "right\n",
      "so in this really kind of i think does a beautiful job chunk of putting sidebyside the dominance theory and the what is it the positive positive reinforcement to get the positive reinforcement for your theory\n",
      "those are the two main ones\n",
      "but just the day almost night and day ways that they see dogs\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "like what makes dogs\n",
      "dogs that to a dominance theory person\n",
      "the dogs just like im in charge of you get out of my way where the the positive reinforcement theory says dog just likes to go have fun in it\n",
      "and its really not very concerned with you know social niceties of letting you go first\n",
      "it wants to go have fun immediately\n",
      "it doesnt really have anything to do with you\n",
      "its a dog\n",
      "exactly\n",
      "i just i dont know if everyones figured this out or not but i tend to fall a little more on the positive reinforcement side\n",
      "same here\n",
      "so lets take a break then and talk about a little bit more about the problems with dominance training but then the joy and the goodness that is positive reinforcement\n",

      "essentially your dog might be fearful\n",
      "and one of the other problems besides harming the relationship between you and your dog that you might even know is armed\n",
      "right\n",
      "is that if your dog is aggressive at all this can really ramp that up and that can be a big problem\n",

      "sure\n",
      "like that sell the shock collars right\n",
      "exactly\n",
      "yes\n",
      "and then people who watch cesar meone right\n",
      "because he is hes a force unto himself as far as dominance training goes because people watch his show and theyre like oh wow this really works\n",
      "liking goats to a dog\n",
      "and the dog will like stop doing what you want to do\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "and so he does he produces results\n",

      "thats thats whats that question\n",
      "its also its heavily edited tv show\n",
      "we have to remember\n",
      "it is\n",
      "well you know he got in a lot of i want to say gotten a lot of trouble\n",
      "hot water\n",

      "there was like a petition that got like 10000 signatures to have a show canceled on nathan national geographic because hes the pig\n",
      "yeah the pig thing where he\n",
      "there was a french bulldog that had killed two potbelly pigs in its pass\n",
      "and the owner was like i dont want my dog to kill pigs anymore\n",
      "caesars like i have just the idea\n",
      "lets put it in a pen with another pig\n",
      "and apparently it was going very well\n",
      "but then they let it off of the lead and the dog attacked the pig and took a chunk out of its ear\n",
      "and they aired this and im sure they aired it because they were trying to be true to their documentary roots\n",
      "i guess rather than just editing the whole thing out be like well we cant show that they included it\n",
      "and there was a lot of outrage\n",
      "and they were like this is a clear act of animal abuse\n",
      "like this pig was harmed because of this shows actions and caesar juans actions\n",
      "and there was an investigation by los angeles county i think to see whether you know they could charge him with animal abuse\n",

      "but it created it produced this round of of interviews for him a lot of publicity for the show\n",
      "but also he did a lot of interviews\n",
      "and in every single one he said i understand that you know the people who are who are who prompted this investigation care about animals\n",

      "and they should\n",
      "and its its great\n",
      "no cooperate\n",
      "but in every single one he stood by dominants training\n",
      "he did not question it for a second\n",
      "thats true\n",
      "you know he still believes in it for sure\n",
      "so on the other side we have positive reinforcement\n",
      "and thats generally like a two pronged thing where you reward good behavior\n",
      "and this next part is really key because its easy to reward good behavior but not accidentally reinforcing bad behavior which you talked about earlier which is someone comes in nico jumps on them and my instinct is to pullar often say no i am reinforcing that bad behavior just by giving her even negative attention\n",
      "right\n",
      "exactly\n",
      "so so what\n",
      "so the whole point of positive reinforcement is ignoring the behavior that you dont want to happen\n",
      "right\n",
      "which means youre not accidentally reinforcing bad behavior and then rewarding the behavior that you do want to happen\n",
      "so in the case of nico the\n",
      "the part where youre ignoring its called extinction where this idea that the unwanted behavior goes away if you do nothing when you come in and shes jumping up you just turn your back to her and ignore and just go about your business and say im packing your shoes\n",
      "maybe youve got a wet bathing suit that you need to get out of your suitcase with my massagers that kind of thing\n",
      "you know youve just come home from a beach vacation as did she does this when i go get the mail\n",
      "ok\n",
      "hey wow\n",
      "ok lets see you come back and youre looking through your your mail your garnet hill catalog\n",
      "and you know youre thinking maybe i will spend a little more on halloween decorations than last year\n",
      "and you you youre ignoring or youre just doing your thing\n",
      "and then the moment she sits quietly and looks up at you bam youre there with the treat\n",
      "yeah but the tug of roe tug of war rope the verbal prey\n",
      "oh yeah\n",
      "youre like you right there\n",
      "and then you go back to it\n",
      "she jumps up and you go right back to your mail\n",
      "you just totally ignore in the moment her feet are on the floor\n",
      "bam youre right back there with another treat\n",
      "so youre youre very consistently this is really really key\n",
      "youre consistently rewarding the behavior that you want and youre consistently ignoring the behavior that you dont want\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "and again im pretty good about this with myself\n",
      "and she doesnt jump on me but its just its with other folks\n",

      "some of our closest friends come over a lot understand and they ignore her and try and turn their back and stuff until she comes down\n",
      "they hate me\n",
      "oh goodness\n",
      "another thing you can use is the clicker\n",
      "that is something you hold in your hand that makes this clicking sound\n",
      "and you just sort of reinforce that along with the treat\n",
      "but they hear that click\n",
      "and i guess its sort of like that pavlovian response where the precision of that click it makes it easier for them to to put two and two together\n",
      "and pretty soon you can make that click and they know like you you know maybe ill just sit down and behave because the treats coming my way while youre with the click i think youre more marking the behavior like theres five different things that shes doing as she say settling in or whatever\n",
      "maybe she was looking up out the window and you say good girl because she sitting down\n",
      "but to her youre saying good girl because shes looking out the window\n",
      "if you clicked if you click the moment she sat down and settled she would know that what you were talking about was the seating the sitting part rather than the looking out the window part\n",
      "the clickers just its it happened so fast it allows the dog to mark that behavior more than your praise\n",
      "right\n",
      "because it takes a lot longer to say neeko youre so good\n",
      "exactly\n",
      "then that little click\n",
      "so youd want to click first and then hit her with the praise\n",
      "but the click is like oh that thing\n",
      "thats right\n",
      "and the consistency that you were talking about is so key because you can be going down a good path for a couple of weeks and undo it all in a couple of days or even a single action\n",
      "if youre not consistent with you know this training\n",
      "but but its like with the the peeing in the house thing maybe in the house the house training that you engage in originally did you didnt quite finish\n",
      "you werent quite consistent enough\n",
      "so go start over\n",
      "its not like its like oh well ill never have a nice frog again for a dog just pees in the house\n",
      "its like no you you go back to house training your dog or\n",
      "right\n",
      "you know if you have this whatever the unwanted behavior is you just have to go back to it and do it again\n",
      "and your dog will pick it up probably way faster the second time and you just stick to it\n",
      "its just more consistency which is why i was saying earlier its you know a little more involved owning a dog than we used to think it was\n",
      "but the dogs that were you know like sharing our lives with our i would argue are way happier and healthier mentally and probably physically too than say they were 30 years ago in general\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "and there is a certain amount you know you dont get dogs and cats if you want to have\n",
      "well not necessarily true but if you need a pristine house thats hairless you probably shouldnt have pets\n",
      "like theres a certain amount of giving in to the fact that\n",
      "i mean and you may have rules where they pets arent allowed on any furniture which is great\n",
      "that helps\n",
      "but like in my house theyre furniture dogs\n",
